# Task 14: Model Comparison & Best Model Selection

## 📌 Objective
To compare multiple machine learning models on a single dataset using the same preprocessing
and train-test split, evaluate their performance, and select the best model.

---

## 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Breast Cancer Dataset** from `scikit-learn`
- Binary classification problem (Malignant vs Benign)

---

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Loaded the dataset
2. Applied preprocessing (Standard Scaling) once
3. Split data into train and test sets
4. Trained multiple models using the same split
5. Evaluated models using:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-score
6. Stored results in a comparison table
7. Plotted bar chart for performance comparison
8. Selected best model based on test accuracy
9. Saved the best model for future use

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

## 🏆 Best Model
The model with the highest **test accuracy** was selected as the best-performing model and saved as:
